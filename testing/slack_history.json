Finish Winterization of Doors:*\n• *$150:* This seems low for _all_ doors. It's more likely $150 _per_ exterior door if it includes weatherstripping, threshold inspection/repair, and potentially a sweep installation. Clarify the scope with the homeowner.\n*2. Electrical:*\n• *Check Lights:* $75 - $150 (depending on complexity).\n• *HVAC/Bathroom Fan Issue:* $150 - $400 (diagnosis and minor repair. Could be higher for complex issues like motor replacement).\n*3. Front Door Doorknob Replacement (Downstairs):*\n• *$50 - $100 (hardware provided by homeowner):* This is a good estimate for a standard doorknob replacement.\n*4. Vent Installation:*\n• *Measurements for Vent Installation:* Included with installation or $50-$75 trip charge if standalone.\n• *Vent Installation over Pocket Door:* $300 - $450 (including materials).\n*5. Thermal Camera Inspection:*\n• *$150:* As quoted.\n*6. Rust Above Shower:*\n• *Minor Rust Removal/Treatment:* $100 - $200.\n• *Significant Rust/Tile Repair/Replacement:* $300+ (potentially much higher depending on the extent of damage).\n*7. Exterior Door Replacement:*\n• *Metal Door:* $800 - $1500+ (including installation).\n• *Fiberglass Door:* $1000 - $2500+ (including installation).\n*8. Mailbox Mounting on Brick Wall:*\n• *$100 - $250 (including basic mailbox):* Higher-end mailboxes will increase the cost.\n*Important Considerations:*\n• *On-Site Assessment:* Highly recommended for all but the simplest tasks (e.g., doorknob replacement) to get accurate quotes.\n• *Material Costs:* Clearly communicate with the homeowner who is responsible for material purchases.\n• *Service Fees/Trip Charges:* Factor in any applicable service fees or trip charges.\n• *Local Market Rates:* These estimates can vary based on location. Ensure they align with your local market.\nBy providing these detailed estimates and clearly outlining the variables that can affect pricing, you'll build trust and transparency with the homeowner.",

Assuming a one-day timeframe (8 hours of labor), and _without_ knowing the full scope, I can give a very rough estimate, but understand this could change significantly.\n*Very Rough Estimate (based on assumed 1-day completion and _subject to change_):*\n• *Labor:* 8 hours x $75/hour (estimated hourly rate) = $600\n• *Materials:* This is very difficult to estimate without specifics, but I'll allocate a placeholder of $150 for materials like drywall, joint compound, primer, paint, etc. This could be higher or lower depending on the actual materials needed.\n• *Total Very Rough Estimate:* $750\n*Important Considerations:*\n• *This estimate is highly preliminary.* It does _not_ include any unforeseen complications that might arise during the repair process (e.g., unexpected damage behind the drywall, difficulty matching texture, etc.).\n• *Travel time and any special equipment rental* are also not factored into this estimate.\n• *The material cost is a guess.* Once I have the dimensions and know what needs replacing/repairing, I can provide a much more precise material cost.\n",

I got a little bit overwhelmed the past week so I did not emphasize that. We may need to call Washington gas to try to detect where the gas smell comes from. It would not show itself when I was there . We may need Washington gas to come out and detect. In my small opinion, it is not that big of an emergency, but it is a faint smell that should not be there.",

Normally valves get replaced.\n\nIs there any photos of the project?",

There is no hot water remaining after someone takes a bath per the owners. \n• *Showerheads pressure*: Pressure remained the same after the work was performed. Plus it looks like the issue is the showerhead itself. Owners say the recommended work related to the pressure was not necessary meaning the cartridges replacements.\nAnything we can do about the hot water?\n<@U03R2N88XB8> owners say \"_do not wish to move forward with processing the payment for these services at this time_\" :laughing:",

We can do that when he is back there for the other items.\n\nIf that doesn't work Dave says the other solution is to move the whole cabinet down for it to open properly which implies adding framing behind the drywall which is more extensive. He estimates that is going to be an added $500.",

The only way to be sure is to inspect all of the plumbing inside of the ceiling by cutting drywall. I don’t think that they would like to do that at the moment.

As part of the complete visit flow we are capturing the arrival/departure times, onsite duration, expenses, before/after photos and job notes. This information is used to automatically create visit reports and will replace the usage of Comments to provide job summaries. Unfortunately we did not release Visits Reports being available in the front office portal (hub) at the same time so there is a gap in visit reports since yesterday and today.\n\nACTION: Over the next 24 hours we will be releasing a temporary solution to auto create a Comment on the order from the visit reports provided by technicians. Then over the next week we will rollout Visit Reports in the Front Office portal. I'm attaching an image of the design that will rollout soon.\n\nExample Visit Report",

The client mentioned that the mold on the ceiling started appearing about a month ago.\n\nI think the condensation issue can be resolved fairly easily with proper insulation, but the mold is a more serious concern. Do we have a mold remediation vendor? I think we’ll need to open up more of the area to assess the full extent of the damage and bring in someone to treat the mold.\n\nPlease let me know best next steps. Thank you!",

It seems like he wants us to install the hybrid water heater without installing the breathe duct for the system to see how it performs. If it doesn’t perform well, he would like to move forward with deducting it to the basement airspace . I have our local vendors and a vendor. I never use before that’s going to email me a quote of the water heater, pipe and fittings all material. I’m waiting to get a response back from them. I am going to close out the ticket now.I will update the ticket as soon as possible when I get those quotes in. The additional rerouting of sewer, pipe and duct pipe are inside of our ticket portal already. I do not have an estimate for the water heater yet. Just FYI.",

The cost is $450 plus materials. Our scope would ensure we blend the wall color (which will need to be color matched) unless you have the paint.\n\nWe will do a localized patch of the ceiling (please anticipate the ceiling patch will not match the existing color of the ceiling) but can increase our scope for the entire ceiling upon request (for an additional amount) if you'd like to proceed with an exact color match for the entire ceiling.

The estimate is $475. 00\nPlease let the homeowner know. So I know how to proceed.

        "text": "To perform a factory reset on a Rheem tankless water heater, follow these steps. The exact process may vary slightly depending on your model, but this is the general method for most Rheem units:\n\nLocate the Control Panel:\nMany Rheem units have a small digital control panel on the front or near the bottom of the unit.\n\nPower Off the Unit:\nTurn off the unit using the power button or by unplugging it from the power outlet.\n1. Press and Hold the Reset Buttons:\n    a. Locate the “Up” and “Down” buttons (typically arrows) and the “Mode” button on the control panel.\n    b. Press and hold both the “Up” and “Down” buttons simultaneously, then also press the “Mode” button while continuing to hold the other buttons.\n    c. Restore Power:\nWhile holding the buttons, plug the unit back in or turn the breaker back on.\n• Wait for the Reset Process:\n• Hold the buttons for about 10-15 seconds until you see the display screen reset or change. This typically indicates that the unit has restored factory settings.\n• Release the Buttons:\nLet go of the buttons once the reset process completes.\n• Confirm Reset:\nThe control panel should display default settings or clear any previous error codes.\n\nAfter the Reset:\n• Reconfigure Settings: If you customized temperature or operational settings, you will need to set them again.\n• Check for Error Codes: See if any error codes return; if they do, there may still be a mechanical or operational issue that needs addressing.\nIf the steps don’t work or the model doesn’t support a manual reset, refer to your specific Rheem unit manual or contact Rheem Customer Support at 1-800-4<tel:1-800-432-8373|32-8373 (as sh>own on the sticker in the image).",

This preparation work facilitates the roofing subcontractor's task.\n• *Roofing Work:* This scope does _not_ include the actual installation of the roof vent cap, flashing, or any other roof-related work. This will be quoted separately. The homeowner is responsible for obtaining necessary approvals from the condo association and coordinating with the roofing subcontractor.
